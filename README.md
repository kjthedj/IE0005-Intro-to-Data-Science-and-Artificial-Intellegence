A machine learning project for the prediction of cardiovascular disease based on certain risk factors.
My team and I used a cardiovascular dataset we found on kaggle to try out different machine learning models to determine the best machine learning model for the prediction of possibility of having heart disease provided that there were certain risk factors such as alcohol conusmption, drinking, blood pressure, exercise gender etc.
